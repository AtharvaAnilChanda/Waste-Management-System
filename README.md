# Waste-Management-System
This repository contains the code implementation of a simple waste management system using C++ . Almost all basic features of C++ and object oriented programming have been accomodated in this monolith of a code .

A few functionalities included as a part of the code are file handling and manipulation , inheritance , use of friend class and friend functions , virtual functions , try catch for exception handling ,error handling , private , public and protected classes and fucntions , static functions, timestamps , loops , pointers , switch cases and a lot more !! 

WasteManagement.cpp consists of the working code and the .csv files are the ones that are being manipulated . Categoies.csv has all the different types of waste and their rates in INR/kg. Transactions.csv stores all records of the transactions alonng with usernames and time stamps . Adminfile.csv stores all admin udernames and passwords. Test.cpp consists of possible changes that could've been made to the code such as manipulating .csv files using environment variables. Both the codes are monoliths of structures and can be made modular .

Feel free to branch it out and make changes to this project if you would like to do so . Hope you enjoy going through it !!
